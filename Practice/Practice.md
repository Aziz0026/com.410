Lab Tasks
=========

You can use the AUCA server for lab work through SSH at 'auca.space'. The login
has the format `<last name>_<first letter of the first name>`.

There are multiple ways to prepare a working environment on Windows ranging from
using a [virtual machines](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) running
[Linux](https://www.ubuntu.com), using the [Linux Subsystem on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10),
using the [MinGW and MSYS](http://www.mingw.org) development environment, or the
[Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com) Unix emulation system among others.

In all cases ensure that you have the following packages installed

* coreutils
* binutils
* gcc
* make
* gdb

## Lab #1, Basics

### Task #1, messages with C

1. Create a C application that prints some text message to the standard output
   stream.

2. Debug the program with [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb). Use the text
   UI mode of the debugger.

```bash
gdb -tui ./<Executable File Name>
```

3. Try to preprocess, compile, and link the program step by step.

```bash
gcc -E <Source File Name> > <Preprocessed File Name>
gcc -c -o <Object File Name>.o <Source File Name>
gcc -o <Executable File Name> <Object File Name>
```

3. Disassemble the program with [objdump](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils)
   and send the output to the pager program `less`. Type `/main<ENTER>` to
   search for the `main` function. Navigate up and down with `j` and `k` keys.
   Type `q` to exit from the pager.

```bash
objdump -D <Executable File Name> | less
```

### Task #2, messages with the x86-64 assembly

1. Write an x86-64 assembly program to print some message to the standard output
   stream. Use the `puts` C standard library function to output the text message
   to the screen. Use the GNU Assembler to translate your program into the
   object file.

2. Step through the instructions with [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb).

3. Rewrite the program in x86 assembly for the 32-bit architecture.

4. Rewrite one program by using the Intel assembly syntax.

### Task #3, messages directly through the operating system

1. Rewrite the 32-bit and the 64-bit programs from task #2 without using the
`puts` function call. Call the operating system kernel directly. Use the `write`
system call.

```bash
man 2 write
```

### Task #4, increment and decrement

1. Write a program that reads one integer number from the standard input stream,
   increments the number by one, and writes the number to the standard output
   stream.

2. Write a program that reads one integer number from the standard input stream,
   decrements the number by one, and writes the number to the standard output
   stream.

In both cases use the C standrad library functions `scanf` and `printf`. In
both cases use the the x86-64 assembly.

```bash
man 3 scanf
man 3 printf
```

### Task #5, Sum of two numbers

1. Write a program in x86-64 assembly that reads two numbers from the standard
   input stream, sums them together, and outputs the result to the standard
   output stream.

```bash
man 3 scanf
man 3 printf
```

### Task #6

1. Write a program in x86-64 assembly to find a sum of 10 integer
   numbers. Create a function to sum the numbers.

### Homework #1

Rewrite all the programs from tasks #4 and #5 in x86 32-bit assembly.

### Compilation

To compile your C program on Linux run the following

    CFLAGS=-g make <Source File Name>

or

    gcc -g -o <Name of the Executable> <C Source File Name>

To translate and link your assembly program run the folowing

    gcc -o <Name of the Executable> <Assembly Source File Name>
